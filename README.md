## ðŸ§© Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 1. **Stepper Integration in React**

**Challenge**:
Integrating the multi-step form (`Stepper`) was tricky, especially when trying to trigger the final API call only on the last step. Also, syncing dynamic state like `patientName`, `email`, etc., across steps while maintaining component reusability was not straightforward.

**Solution**:
Handled state lifting and ensured final step triggers the `bookAppointment()` function. Added form validation and UI feedback using simple conditionals and alerts.

### 2. **Handling Dynamic Modals and Content Resizing**

**Challenge**:
Content inside the modal changed dynamically depending on the step, which made the modal size inconsistent.

**Solution**:
Used `w-fit` with Tailwind CSS and adjusted inner component width using `max-w` and `min-w` utilities. This ensured consistent and responsive modal layout.

### 3. **Simple Challenge â€“ Placeholder Styling**

**Challenge**:
Customizing the placeholder color to match the UI theme wasnâ€™t working initially.

**Solution**:
Added a CSS rule using `::placeholder` to manually override the placeholder color while maintaining full visibility with `opacity: 1`.
